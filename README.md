## This app was created to provide mall coupons for small businesses that are not yet in the mobile marketplace but desire to be.

### Description
This application aims to support small businesses by providing them with a platform to offer coupons and promotions to potential customers within a mall environment. It was developed using React Native tools for cross-platform compatibility and Firebase storage for storing client and coupon data.

### Features
- **Coupon Management:** Small businesses can create, manage, and update their coupons within the app.
- **Client Registration:** Users can register as clients to access and redeem available coupons.
- **Firebase Integration:** Utilizes Firebase storage to securely store client information and coupon data.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Developed using React Native, ensuring compatibility across both iOS and Android platforms.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Designed with an intuitive interface to provide ease of use for both businesses and clients.

### Technologies Used
- **React Native:** Framework for building native mobile applications using JavaScript and React.
- **Firebase:** Backend-as-a-Service platform providing various services including storage, authentication, and real-time database.
- **JavaScript:** Language used for programming the app's logic.
- **HTML/CSS:** Used for structuring and styling the application's components.

### How to Use
1. **Installation:** Clone the repository and install dependencies.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/VitorGuilherme/your-app.git
   cd your-app
   npm install
Firebase Setup: Set up a Firebase project and configure Firebase storage for storing data.
Run the App: Start the application on your emulator or physical device.
bash
Copy code
npm start
Future Improvements
Implement push notifications to notify users about new coupons and promotions.
Enhance security measures to protect client and coupon data.
Integrate payment options for purchasing coupons or premium features.

This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app — you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Step 3: Modifying your App

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.

1. Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.
2. For **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Developer Menu** (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on Window and Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on macOS)) to see your changes!

   For **iOS**: Hit <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and see your changes!

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
